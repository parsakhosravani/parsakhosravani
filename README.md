Five years ago, I started with the programming language C#. After a while, I learned frontend technologies such as HTML/CSS and, bootstrap. Afterwards, I started developing some extra skills on my own and learned JavaScript. Subsequently, I applied for a frontend position. Being a frontend developer allowed me to learn many other skills including jQuery, ASP.NET MVC. Additionally,I learned the Agile methodologies and used Scrum. I am still working on developing other frontend skills such as React and Vue.
I’m always interested and willing to find solutions for the problems I encounter doing my work.
